# ðŸš€ Excited to Share: Playwright Release Notes Examples

I'm thrilled to announce my new open source project: **Playwright Release Notes Examples**!

As web automation and testing continues to evolve, staying current with the latest Playwright features can be challenging. That's why I've created a comprehensive resource with working code examples that demonstrate new features from each Playwright release.

## What's included:
- âœ… Practical, runnable examples for features in Playwright v1.50-v1.52
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing
- âœ… Clear documentation for each new feature
- âœ… Organized by version for easy reference

If you're using Playwright for testing or automation, this repository will help you quickly understand and implement new features as they're released.

## Featured examples:
- Enhanced class assertions
- Aria snapshots with improved accessibility testing
- Request API enhancements
- New configuration options
