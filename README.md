This repository provides working code examples for features introduced in each Playwright version, making it easier to:

1. ‚ú® Understand what's new in each release
2. üîç Learn how to use new features with practical examples
3. üß™ Compare implementation approaches across versions
4. üöÄ Test and experiment with new APIs

## üìö Project Structure

Each version has its own dedicated examples directory:

- [`v1.50.0-examples/`](./v1.50.0-examples/) - Test step timeout, conditional step skipping, accessibility improvements
