**A comprehensive demonstration of new features and improvements in [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) releases**

</div>

---

This repository provides working code examples for features introduced in each Playwright version, making it easier to:

1. ‚ú® Understand what's new in each release
2. üîç Learn how to use new features with practical examples
3. üß™ Compare implementation approaches across versions
4. üöÄ Test and experiment with new APIs

## üìö Project Structure

Each version has its own dedicated examples directory:

- [`v1.50.0-examples/`](./v1.50.0-examples/) - Test step timeout, conditional step skipping, accessibility improvements
- [`v1.51.0-examples/`](./v1.51.0-examples/) - IndexedDB storage, visibility filtering, contrast emulation 
- [`v1.52.0-examples/`](./v1.52.0-examples/) - Class assertions, enhanced aria snapshots, request options

Each directory contains:
- `new-features.spec.ts` - Practical test examples demonstrating the features
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation of the features with reference links
- `playwright.config.ts` - Configuration using version-specific options
